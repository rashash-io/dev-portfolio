## Getting Started
If you need any help with this project, don't hesitate to contact me, 
I'll be more than happy to help. All my contact info are on the project under the contact page. 
### 
I have it on bacause deploying to GitHub pages requires it to be enabled.
If you are going to run this project on your machine, make sure that the `output: "export",`.
is commented out. since this is used 

At the root of your app, create a .env folder to store secrets safley & add the following to it 
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE = service_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE = template_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_KEY = key
```
replace the service_name , template_name, & key with the corrosponding variables you got from emailJS

###  


First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
